Welcome to my site. I built this website to share the [projects](/projects) I work on with friends, family, and others who might be interested. I also post some of my personal [notes](/notes) on technical topics, including some how-to guides. 

I'm an engineer living in the San Francisco Bay Area near San Jose. I'm currently taking several gap months after university to build projects, study topics in computer science, and meet other passionate people in STEM.

Feel free to send me a [message](/contact), visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/narekboghozian), or add me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/narek-boghozian-96135110a)! 

<!-- I am deeply passionate about engineering, science, technology, design, philosophy, culture, economics, and management.  -->

<!-- Although I am taking time off, I am currently open to roles in software engineering and related fields. -->
